# Line ending policy (Windows-friendly):
# - With `core.autocrlf=true`, Git checks out text as CRLF on Windows,
#   but normalizes to LF in the repo on commit.
# - Avoid setting `eol=lf` globally, because it overrides `core.autocrlf`.
* text=auto

# Keep attributes files stable cross-platform
/.gitattributes text eol=lf
/.gitignore text eol=lf

# Treat these as text (no forced checkout eol)
*.py   text
*.md   text
*.yaml text
*.yml  text
*.json text
*.toml text
*.txt  text
